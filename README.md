# TASK-WEB

Project Overview
This project is a simple web application designed to collect user information—specifically their name and age—through a basic form. Upon submission, the data is stored in a MySQL database and displayed in a table below the form.

http://localhost/user_project/index.php

Each entry in the table includes a toggle button that allows the user to switch the status between 0 and 1. The status update occurs instantly using AJAX, without refreshing the page.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, making it a practical example for learning how to integrate a front-end interface with a back-end database and implement real-time data updates.
